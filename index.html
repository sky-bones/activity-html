    <h1>Terrarium Bots, The Tiny Worlds of the Future</h1>

    <p><strong>Imagine the Earth millions of years from now.</strong></p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p2>We are living in bunkers, isolated from the outside world, desperate for the tiny sparse greenery that thrives on the dead lands of our crumbling planet. </p2>
    
    <p>Scientist have been creating time glass globes and filling them with oxygen and carbon dioxide, hoping to create tiny atmospheres in vain hope that they can re-create the planets' atmosphere.</p> 
    
    <p>Imagine seeing the tiny storms form, and seeing it pour rain in a tiny glass egg. The bot's life has begun. so you</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>wait and</li>
        <li>wait and</li>
        <li>wait</li>
        <li>until</li>
    </ul>
    
  <h2>Life Begins to Emerge</h2>
    
    <img src="Images/teranium-bot-2-.jpg" alt="Another Terrariam Bot, with a small ecosystem of rocks and small bushes-like plants.">
    
   <p>One by one, the tiny bots spring to life.</p>
    
    <p2>You watch the tiny egg slowly coming to life. Billions of years pass in an instant. micro-storms appear, tiny oceans fill, and then slowly drain. The tiny atmospheres begin to create ecosystems.</p2> 
    
    <ol>
        <li>This is strange, you say.</li>
        <li>This should take billions of years.</li>
        <li>This <strong>shouldn't be possible.</strong></li>
    </ol>
   
   <p>You begin to see tiny spots of life, green and brown, slowly beginning to emerge from the drops of water, and then in span of a few seconds, a miniature ecosystem is born.</p>
    
    <p2>As the bots slowly blooms, the long spindly legs prop it up. It begins to skitter around, seeking something.</p2>
    
    <h2>Sunlight.</h2>
    
    <p>But there is no sunlight in a steel bunker under the earth.</p>
    
    <img src="images1/teranium-bot-3.jpg" alt="A third terrariam bot, with murky water in it. There are small lily-pads floating near the top.">
    
    <p>You decicde to let the bots explore the bunker.</p>
    
    <p2>You know there is no sunlight, but there are a few sun-like lights around the structure. They could settle down there.</p2>
    
    <p>The tiny bots scurry off, the glass case shinning faintly in the dim lights.</p>
    
    
    <ul>
        <li>searched and,</li>
        <li>searched and,</li>
        <li>searched</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Down and around the halls the went, looking into cracks and crevices.</p>
    
    <p2>Suddenly, one stops.</p2>
    
    <p>The rest of the bots scuttle over to it, and they all begin to march in a line.</p>
    
    <p>You follow slowly, curious to see what they have found. Closer and closer to one of the large doors sealing the bunker from the outside world.</p>
    
    <p>There is a small change in the light. You are forced to squint. You realize that the first bot has stop, and its glass case has a long thin beam of light reflecting off it.</p>
    
    <h3>Sunlight</h3>
    
    <h2>Sunlight</h2>
    
    <h1>Sunlight</h1>
    
    <p>In an impenetrable bunker, there is a note of sunlight.</p>
    
    <p>This should be impossible, but this has been a day of firsts.</p>
    
    <p>you walk over to the door and but your eye to the tiny puncture in the door.</p>
    
    <p>Outside, the scrub world that you left all those years ago has come back to life, all at once.</p>
    
    <p>The Earth has come back to life.</p>
